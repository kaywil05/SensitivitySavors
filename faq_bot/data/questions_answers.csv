0,"what is gluten?","Gluten has properties that lend well to baking. Dough becomes elastic and stretchy as the gluten network is developed during the kneading process. The protein network formed from gluten allows bread to rise by trapping air bubbles and helps dough maintain its shape during baking. Gluten provides bread with its chewy texture."
1,"is gluten bad for me?","Gluten is not harmful to the average person, so gluten-free diets are not recommended for the general public. However, those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance may experience harmful or unpleasant effects from gluten consumption."
2,"who needs to follow a gluten-free diet?","Those who have been diagnosed with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet. About one in 133 people in the U.S. has celiac disease, according to the Celiac Foundation. Those with gluten intolerance (non-celiac gluten sensitivity) experience less severe symptoms. They may experience nausea, headaches, gas, bloating and/or abdominal pain. Visit with your health-care provider about your symptoms for an accurate diagnosis."
3,"are celiac disease, gluten intolerance and wheat allergy the same conditions?","These conditions are different from each other. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease in which the intestinal wall is damaged by the consumption of gluten. For individuals with celiac disease, consuming even a small amount of gluten can cause damage to the intestines and digestive symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, abdominal pain and/or fatigue. About one in 10 celiac patients also experiences an itchy rash called dermatitis herpetiformis.

For individuals with gluten intolerance, the body cannot digest the gluten. Digestive symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating and gas are common in gluten intolerance. Sometimes, gluten intolerance is mistaken for a wheat allergy.

Wheat allergies, on the other hand, can be life-threatening. In the case of allergic individuals, eating wheat can trigger an immune response when wheat is consumed. The body recognizes the substance as a foreign invader and begins fighting it in an aggressive manner. Those who suffer from wheat allergies may experience hives, itching, swelling of skin, lips and throat, and/or difficulty breathing. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Food products that contain wheat must be labeled “Contains wheat” near the ingredient statement to signal those with wheat allergies."
4,"how is celiac disease diagnosed?","If you are experiencing symptoms, see your health-care provider. Celiac disease is diagnosed by a blood test and, potentially, a biopsy of the intestinal wall."
5,"how do i know if a food product is gluten-free?","Celiac patients know they should avoid wheat pasta and rye bread, but sometimes gluten can be somewhat “hidden” in foods, cosmetics, medications and other items.

Here are some products that may contain gluten:

• Cosmetics (lipstick, lip balm)

• Herbal or nutritional supplements

• Medications

• Playdough

• Personal care items (toothpaste, mouthwash)

• Condiments

• Sauces and gravies (soy sauce, etc.)

• Candy and candy bars

• Communion wafers

• Processed meat products (meat substitutes)

• Soup bases

• Beer, ales, lager, malt beverages, malt vinegars

Read food and product labels carefully and do your research to find out which foods contain gluten. You may need to contact the manufacturer."
6,"what can i eat if i need to follow a gluten-free diet?","At first, following a gluten-free diet may seem overwhelming. You also may notice that gluten-free products in the grocery store are more expensive than conventional foods. However, eating gluten-free does not need to be difficult or expensive because many foods are naturally gluten-free.

Choose more “whole foods” and fewer processed foods. Vegetables, fruits, meats, fish, seafood, nuts, beans (pinto, kidney, etc.), poultry, eggs, rice, dairy and many other foods are naturally gluten-free. Those on a gluten-free diet should take care with added sauces or seasonings, which may contain gluten. Check the ingredient list and package statements to ensure that your meal is gluten-free.

If you or someone you know follows a gluten-free diet, a registered dietitian or doctor can help you know what to look for on a label. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed standards for voluntary labeling of products as “gluten free.” This uniform definition helps consumers with celiac disease choose gluten-free foods with greater confidence."
7,"What is gluten?","Storage proteins found in grains"
8,"What types of gluten-related disorders are there?","Celiac Disease or gluten sensitivity"
9,"What is Celiac Disease?","Celiac disease is a chronic digestive and immune disorder that damages the small intestine and prevents the body from absorbing nutrients from food. It's caused by an inherited sensitivity to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes oats. When someone with celiac disease eats gluten, their immune system attacks their small intestine, damaging the lining. This can lead to malnutrition and other serious health problems."
10,"Why is Celiac Disease so serious?","It damages the small intestine"
11,"What is gluten sensitivity?","Bodily responses from ingesting gluten"
12,"What are some symptoms of gluten sensitivity?","Gastrointestinal problems, rash, or fatigue"
13,"I heard there are different types of vegetarians. Can you explain the differences?","Vegetarians who consume plant-based foods as well as dairy products are called lacto-vegetarians. Those who include eggs, but not dairy, are called ovo-vegetarians, and individuals who consume both dairy and eggs are called lacto-ovo vegetarians. Vegans eat only plant-based foods and exclude all meat, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs."
14,"What foods should I eat to get the protein I need, and how much is required?","This is a common question that clients and patients ask dietitians, since many no longer eat red meat, poultry, seafood, and fish, or do so sparingly. Protein is the building block of lean body mass and is essential for repairing damaged cells. It transports other nutrients throughout the circulatory system and serves as an energy source when carbohydrate intake is low. According to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 10% to 30% of daily calories should come from protein.

The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein for all persons is 0.8 g/kg of body weight. Based on this recommendation, a 150-lb adult who eats red meat, poultry, seafood, or fish can meet his or her protein needs by eating 54 g of protein/day, about 11% of 2,000 kcal/day. Research has shown, however, that because the protein digestibility scores (the preferred method for measuring the protein value in human nutrition) for vegetarians is only about 90% and 76% for vegans because they don’t eat dairy and eggs, they should aim for a 20% increase in protein intake or 1.0 g/kg of body weight per day.2 A 150-lb adult who eats a vegetarian diet should consume 68 g of protein/day, about 14% of 2,000 kcal/day.

By comparison, the DASH diet allows individuals to eat small amounts of flesh foods to meet a daily protein intake of 18% (nearly 80 g) based on 2,000 kcal/day.
It’s easier for clients to reach their protein goals if they eat beef, fowl, and fish but they can get the same quality protein from eating a variety of legumes, grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, nut butters, and seeds.3 The best vegan source of protein based on protein grams per calorie is soyfood, such as edamame (soybeans), tofu, and tempeh—which is tofu combined with grains. Soymilk’s protein content is comparable to cow’s milk. Seitan (wheat gluten) adapts as easily as tofu and tempeh in recipes, as it takes on the flavor of the herbs and seasonings added during cooking. In addition, beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds, and even whole grains are good protein sources for vegans."
15,"How can legumes fit into a plant-based diet?","Legumes, which include beans, peas, and lentils, can be cooked with brown rice and other grains and incorporated into vegan- and vegetarian-based soups and other dishes. “Legumes, in addition to being a high-protein vegetarian option, are naturally chock full of other beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins, minerals, healthful fat, and antioxidants, with very little saturated fat, sodium, and cholesterol,” says Sharon Palmer, RDN, author of The Plant-Powered Diet and Plant-Powered for Life, and a member of the Vegetarian Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group (VN DPG) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy). “It’s speculated that eating legumes—which form a key part of a healthful plant-based diet—may be one of the many reasons vegetarian diets are often linked with lower disease risk.”

Often, people avoid eating legumes because they cause gas and bloating. Mark Rifkin, MS, RD, LDN, owner of a private nutrition practice in Baltimore and a VN DPG member, offers suggestions to clients to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) distress. “The liquid in soaked or canned beans is the culprit of intestinal gas,” Rifkin says. “Always soak dried beans for eight to 10 hours and rinse them before cooking. Also, rinse canned beans before using.” He also recommends clients increase bean consumption slowly. First, they should begin eating lentils or split peas, then try black and pinto beans, chickpeas, and black-eyed peas."
16,"Are prepackaged vegetarian foods good for me?"," It used to be that meat analogs and nondairy milks and cheeses were sold only in specialty food stores. Now, most supermarkets sell several varieties of veggie burgers, soy bacon, soy nuggets and crumbles, and vegetarian hot dogs. These foods are convenient because they require little cooking time, but it’s always best for clients to choose whole, minimally processed plant-based foods, which are naturally low in saturated fat, sugar, and sodium. Suggest they choose healthier options such as tofu, tempeh, textured vegetable protein, and seitan, and save the faux meats and processed treats for only special occasions."
17,"Is a vegetarian diet really healthier than a nonvegetarian diet?","Research shows plant-based diets reduce the risk of cardiovascular and other chronic illnesses such as heart attack and stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers. A recent study by Soret and colleagues found that plant-based diets have a positive impact on human health and life expectancy.4 Individuals who ate a vegetarian or semivegetarian diet had mortality rates 16% to 17% lower than nonvegetarians, and had all-cause mortality rates 9% to 14% lower than nonvegetarians.4 The study also noted that people who ate highly processed, high-fat vegetarian foods over whole plant foods also had a reduction in mortality risk compared with nonvegetarians.4 In the landmark Adventist Health Study 2 (AHS-2), in which 96,000 Seventh-day Adventist participants were surveyed to determine the effects of different dietary patterns on chronic disease risk, researchers found that vegetarian dietary patterns led to a 12% and 28% lower mortality rate in vegetarians and vegans, respectively, and more favorable chronic disease outcomes.5 Mortality rates for semivegetarians in the AHS-2 didn’t differ significantly from those of nonvegetarians.5 The Academy’s position paper on vegetarian diets provides similar findings, stating that vegetarian diets are associated with lower BMI; cholesterol; heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer risk; and blood pressure.6"
18,"I eat meat occasionally. Can I call myself a vegetarian?"," A vegetarian is an individual who consumes plant-based foods such as grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruit, and excludes beef, chicken, turkey, fish, and other flesh foods. Their diets may include dairy products and eggs. A semi-vegetarian enjoys a plant-based dietary pattern but eats beef, pork, poultry, or fish occasionally, such as once or twice per week.

Many clients and patients label themselves as vegetarian even though they occasionally eat meat and fish, so it’s important for dietitians to understand their diet history to counsel them appropriately."
19,"Do I need to take supplements as a vegetarian?","Vegetarians can meet most of their micronutrient needs on a plant-based diet. However, plant-based eaters, especially vegans, can fall short on food sources of vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, and calcium.

Research shows that anywhere between 30% and 86% of healthy, adult vegetarians experience a vitamin B12 deficiency, since there aren’t any adequate plant-based forms of the nutrient.7 “Vegetarian diets are associated with vitamin B12 depletion or deficiency regardless of the type of diet vegetarians eat,” says Roman Pawlak, PhD, RD, an associate professor in the department of nutrition science at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, who coauthored a 2013 literature review in which 18 articles were examined to assess the vitamin B12 status of vegetarians, including lacto-ovo vegetarians, lacto-vegetarians, vegans, and those following a macrobiotic diet. “Vegans in particular must take a B12 supplement after talking to their doctor. It’s recommended that all vegetarians do the same.” While it’s long been accepted that a vegan diet poses a high risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, the idea that less-restrictive vegetarians should be closely monitored for shortfalls or supplement to the same degree as vegans remains controversial. (See the article “Vitamin B12” in Today’s Dietitian’s August 2014 issue.)

Vitamin D deficiency among vegetarians also is a concern since they don’t eat salmon, mackerel, or other types of oily cold-water fish, which are considered good sources. (Lacto-ovo vegetarians can get vitamin D through fortified milk and eggs.) Vegans are at risk of deficiency because they avoid fish, eggs, and dairy products (fortified with vitamin D). Their only alternatives are to consume vitamin D–fortified orange juice and breakfast cereals, mushrooms with vitamin D, and take a vitamin D supplement. “As very few foods are fortified, it’s challenging for vegetarians to obtain adequate amounts through the diet. A vegan supplement is recommended if dietary intake is inadequate,” Pawlak says. However, both vegetarians and vegans can boost their vitamin D intake by getting at least 15 minutes of sunlight exposure daily, which produces vitamin D in the skin.

And since vegetarians and vegans avoid red meat, poultry, and shellfish, they run the risk of not consuming or absorbing adequate iron. Plant foods contain nonheme iron, which is less absorbed than heme iron found in animal protein. To ensure clients meet daily requirements, suggest they use a cast-iron skillet for cooking to boost iron content, and combine vitamin C–rich foods, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, kale, and citrus fruits, with iron-rich sources, such as beans, tomatoes, baked potatoes, soybeans, and pumpkin seeds, for better absorption. Recommend clients increase iron intake by using black strap molasses in baking, adding raisins to iron-fortified cereals with soymilk, and increasing their intake of beans and lentils. Warn clients that they shouldn’t take iron supplements that have more than 100% of the RDA unless a physician is supervising them.

Calcium deficiency also is a concern. Lacto-vegetarians can consume milk, yogurt, and cheese, while vegans should choose calcium-fortified tofu, soymilk, tempeh, as well as legumes, green leafy vegetables, almonds, sesame seeds, and black strap molasses to meet daily requirements. If they aren’t eating these foods regularly, dietitians should recommend a calcium supplement taken in divided doses to fill in the gap."
20,"I have food sensitivities. Can I still follow a vegetarian eating pattern?","Yes, clients and patients who have food sensitivities or intolerances can eat a vegetarian or vegan meal pattern with guidance from a dietitian. Clients with lactose intolerance experience GI disturbances, such as flatulence, abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, following intake of an amount of lactose that’s greater than their body’s ability to digest it. Patients with lactose maldigestion experience a decline in the activity of the enzyme lactase that facilitates the digestion of dairy. Dietitians can tell vegetarian clients that even though they have lactose intolerance or lactose maldigestion, they can still enjoy dairy products in small amounts at meals or purchase lactose-free options in the grocery store. To date, there are many nondairy plant milks, yogurts, and cheese alternatives available in stores for lactose-intolerant vegetarians and vegans. However, some of these specialty dairy foods aren’t the best options due to their extra sugar and fat content. Guide clients on reading the labels to find the best products for them.

Individuals who have nonceliac gluten sensitivity can’t digest the protein gluten found in wheat products and therefore may experience gas, bloating, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms. The good news is that there are many gluten-free products on the market, such as gluten-free breads, muffins, pastas, cereals, snacks, and desserts. And there are several resources dietitians can share with clients to help them adopt a healthful gluten-free vegetarian or vegan diet.

Clients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience abdominal pain, bloating, cramping, diarrhea, and constipation caused by a sensitivity to a high-FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet that contains short-chain carbohydrates (eg, lactose, fructose, fructans, polyols, and galactans/galacto-oligosaccharides) found in certain fruits, vegetables, grains, milk products, dried peas and beans, corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, and sugar alcohols found in nonnutritive sweeteners.10 To treat IBS symptoms, many dietitians are recommending clients consume a low-FODMAP diet or a patient-targeted elimination diet. The low-FODMAP elimination diet is based on limiting short-chain carbohydrate-containing foods clients can’t fully digest and absorb, and dietitians are in the best position to develop meal plans they can follow for optimal health.

“Since legumes are such a valuable source of protein in the vegetarian diet, choosing those with the lowest FODMAP content might be best tolerated in vegetarians who experience IBS symptoms,” says Kate Scarlata, RDN, LDN, author of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Eating Well With IBS and 21-Day Tummy. Scarlata suggests IBS patients eat “firm tofu, tempeh, and small amounts of canned lentils [1/2 cup] or canned chickpeas [1/4 cup]. Other sources of plant-based protein such as quinoa, peanut butter, or a handful of walnuts, pecans, peanuts, or macadamia nuts can be enjoyed on the low-FODMAP diet too.”"
21,"How much protein should I eat?","Adults need at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, but athletes and those who exercise regularly need more."
22,"How much caffeine is safe?","Most health experts agree that up to 400 mg per day is safe for average adults."
23,"What are some healthy snack options?","Fruit, like grapes, mandarin oranges, or berries, are healthy options. You can also try red pepper strips with hummus, or celery with natural nut butter."
24,"How do I eat healthily to lose weight?","A dietitian or nutritionist can provide specific advice on how to tailor your diet to lose weight."
25,"How can I eat healthy on a budget?","You can buy fresh fruits and vegetables when they are in season. You can also freeze some vegetables to use later."
26,"What are some tips for eating well?","Avoid overcooking vegetables and fruit as this can lead to the loss of important vitamins. When using canned or dried vegetables and fruit, choose varieties without added salt and sugars."
27,"How Can I Drink More Water?","Try drinking a glass upon waking and one with every meal. For a flavor boost, add a spritz of citrus, like lemon or lime. Proper hydration is vital for health. It helps regulate body temperature, removes waste, lubricates joints, helps prevent infections, shuttles nutrients to cells and helps organs function properly."
28,"Why Should I Eat a High-Fiber Diet?","Dietary fiber from fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes can help maintain a healthy weight, lower blood cholesterol and glucose levels, help food pass through the digestive system, promote regularity and prevent constipation. Aim for at least 25 grams per day."
29,"Do I Need to Eat Breakfast?","Those who eat breakfast tend to eat less throughout the day, and studies have shown that breakfast improves cognitive performance, especially in school-age children. Skipping breakfast may leave you feeling tired and hungry, which can lead to poor dietary choices."
30,"How Can I Eat More Healthfully?","Fill up on nutrients the body needs—vitamins, minerals, complex carbs, lean protein, and healthy fats—by eating a varied diet of nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, beans, and nuts."
31,"What Are Healthy Fats?","Unsaturated fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, that can lower your risk for heart disease or stroke are considered good for you. For monounsaturated fats, think olive, canola, peanut, and sunflower oils, as well as avocados and most nuts. Polyunsaturated fats are in corn and soybean oils and in walnuts, sesame, pumpkin and flax seeds. Omega-3 fatty acids are a type of polyunsaturated fat in salmon, mackerel, tuna, and trout."
32,"How Many Fruits and Vegetables Should I Eat?","At least half your plate should consist of fruits and vegetables. You can't get all the nutrients you need from a single fruit or vegetable, so it's important to consume a variety of both. Men and women between the ages of 19 and 50 should aim for 2-1/2 to 3 cups of veggies per day and 1-1/2 to 2 cups of fruit. To make it easy, look for Hy-Vee Short Cuts pre-washed and cut fruits and vegetables in the produce department."
33,"What Are Probiotics and Prebiotics?","Tiny microbes referred to as probiotics in fermented foods, like yogurt, may aid digestive function, regularity and improve overall immune health. Prebiotics can affect the growth of immune-boosting helpful bacteria throughout your gastrointestinal tract."
34,"Should I substitute cow milk for plant-based milk?","Many plant-based milks lack adequate calcium, vitamin D, protein and fat, that children younger than 5 require for adequate growth and development. On the other hand, cow’s milk is a great source of protein; calcium; vitamins A, D and B12; potassium; phosphorus; riboflavin; and niacin. Having such a nutrient-dense product is essentially unmatched in plant-based milks which are not nutritionally equivalent to cow’s milk. In fact, many plant-based milks also have added sugars which you want to avoid giving to young children."
35,"Is it a good idea to combine both dairy and plant-based milk?","A combination of dairy and plant-based milks could be doable if it fits the family goals. Plant-based milks tend to be more expensive, so purchasing more than one type of beverage might not be feasible for families. You also need to ensure your child is meeting nutrient requirements with a well-balanced diet if both types of milk are given."
36,"Why does my child need vitamin D and calcium?","Vitamin D is essential in helping to regulate calcium absorption in the body. The calcium is used to build strong bones. Most, 90%, of peak bone mass is acquired by age 18 for females and 20 for males. Therefore, it is extremely important our children start with a good foundation to build strong bones for life."
37,"My child has a dairy allergy, what type of milk should I give them?","Fortified soy milk is recognized by the USDA as the allowable substitute for federal programs such as WIC (The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) or school meals. If a patient is allergic to dairy and soy, other beverages can be used; however, this should be done under the supervision of a registered dietitian and/or pediatrician to ensure your child is meeting all of their nutrient needs."
38,"My picky child will only drink chocolate milk, is that an OK substitute?","That was the thinking in the past. However, sugar guidelines were released and we know it is recommended children younger than 2 should not be given added sugars and those older than 2 years of age should be limited to less than 25 grams of added sugars per day (6 teaspoons). Flavored milks have added sugars which we are trying to limit as much as possible."
39,"Should I feed my child whole milk yogurt or low-fat yogurt?","For young children, whole milk yogurt is ideal to provide additional fats the body and brain may need. For older children, lower-fat yogurt can be worked into an overall healthy diet. The key is to look for a yogurt with minimal added sugars and use something such as fresh fruit to sweeten it."
40,"Are dairy allergies the only reason to take my child off dairy milk?","Yes; early childhood is the prime time for development. Dairy milk has proven over time to be an excellent nutrient-dense food beneficial to overall health. If a child has a dairy allergy (or family preference to avoid dairy), I highly encourage families to work with a registered dietitian and/or nutritionist to ensure adequate nutrients are being provided."
41,"When might you need to follow a dairy-free diet?","People diagnosed as allergic or intolerant to dairy may need to follow a dairy-free diet. Luckily, with a little knowledge it can be a lot easier to shop and eat dairy-free than you might imagine."
42,"What is a dairy allergy?","This occurs when your immune system reacts to one or more of the proteins (albumin, casein or whey) present in milk. If you are allergic, you will experience an immediate Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. This response can be triggered by a very small amount of milk protein.

Reactions range in severity from acute symptoms like eczema, hives or diarrhoea to potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis or chronic malabsorption and inflammation. The only effective treatment is to fully eliminate milk and any products containing it."
43,"What is an intolerance?","Most often this refers to an intolerance to lactose, the sugar naturally found in milk (cow, goat and sheep). We make an enzyme in our intestine called lactase, which breaks down the lactose in milk allowing it to be absorbed. As we age, some of us fail to produce sufficient amounts of lactase and without it, the sugar ferments in the gut. An intolerance to dairy is less severe than an allergy but it may still lead to digestive, skin and inflammatory symptoms. However, if your intolerance isn't due to lactose, it's likely to be caused by the protein component of milk.

Those with an intolerance may find they're able to consume small amounts of milk with no ill-effects, particularly the products which have been processed such as live yogurt or cottage cheese. Some people find it easier to tolerate the milk of goat, sheep or buffalo, rather than cow’s milk. We're all different and you'll need to establish your personal tolerance levels."
44,"What are the health implications of a dairy-free diet?","Milk is nutrient dense and makes a useful contribution towards our nutrient intake – from providing a protein source to supplying minerals like calcium and iodine as well as vitamins such as the B group and vitamin A.

We typically value dairy foods for their calcium content but, fortunately, there are plenty of alternative food sources such as green leafy vegetables and nuts and fish with bones, such as tinned sardines. Speak to your GP if you suspect you may be at risk of a nutritional deficiency, including a calcium deficiency.

In the UK, milk and dairy products are also one of the main sources of iodine. This little-talked-about nutrient is important for thyroid function. Those most at risk are young girls and pregnant women."
45,"How will I know which foods to omit on a dairy-free diet?","Eating dairy-free involves omitting any product containing milk – these include the obvious ones like butter, yogurt, cream and cheese but you will also need to check labels for the following:

Casein/caseinates
Whey
Ghee (though vegetable ghee is fine)
Buttermilk
Hydrolysed casein/whey
Lactalbumin
Lactose
Don’t forget milk and milk derivatives are likely to be found in:

Batter (for pancakes, waffles, fish fingers etc.)
Bread – many enriched breads will include butter and/or milk
Low-fat and vegetable spreads
Synthetic cream
Crème pâtissière and custard
Sweeteners"
46,"What are the alternatives to cow's milk?","Some people are able to tolerate goat, sheep or buffalo milk – these are readily available as both fresh and UHT products including milk, cream, yogurt and cheese.

Plant-based alternatives such as rice, oat, almond, coconut and soya are now widely available. Look for fortified versions which have nutrients like calcium and, in some cases, iodine added to them. If you're looking for a butter alternative, coconut oil works well – otherwise check labels carefully because some margarines contain whey or casein, and they also may not perform well when used for high temperature cooking such as frying."
47,"Is a dairy-free diet safe for everyone?","Dairy makes a valuable contribution to a healthy, balanced diet – this means if you have to replace dairy foods you need to ensure you get enough calcium, iodine and other key nutrients from the substitutes you choose. Failing to do so may result in nutrient deficiencies.

If you or your child have been advised to follow a dairy-free diet, request a referral to a registered dietician for specialist help and guidance.

If you suspect you are intolerant or allergic to dairy, refer to your GP for a diagnosis."
48,"What are some popular Mexican dishes?","At Mexican restaurants in the States, common dishes include burritos, tacos, and enchiladas (Although burritos are actually not very common in Mexico and typically only eaten in specific areas in northern Mexico). There are countless other traditional Mexican dishes that are popular as well, like mole, sopes, carnitas, and tostadas."
49,"Is Mexican food unhealthy?","People often think that Mexican food is unhealthy…but most authentic Mexican food is actually healthy. Authentic Mexican food is cooked with a wide variety of spices and fresh ingredients such as chiles, tomatoes, onions, cinnamon, cumin, and more. Mexican food revolves around whole foods and meats. Beans, rice, and salsas made with tomatoes and chiles are a central part of Mexican cuisine. Unhealthy Mexican food is often found at restaurants in the US that have “Americanized” the food and added unhealthy ingredients."
50,"Is all Mexican food spicy?","A common misconception about Mexican food is that it is for the most part – very spicy… but that couldn’t be further from the truth. While Mexican food uses a variety of fresh and dried chiles in many salsas, sauces, and meat braises, more often than not, they provide complex flavor rather than spice or “heat”. 

The spice level in Mexican food is often just based on personal preference and many in Mexico do enjoy spice. When cooking Mexican food that contains chile, feel free to remove the pith and seeds of the chile, which is where most of the heat comes from. You can also leave out the chile entirely to keep your food mild. 

The spiciest chiles in Mexican cooking are habaneros, serrano chiles, and chile de arbol, so if spicy food isn’t for you, keep these out. Fresh chiles like jalapenos and poblanos, and dried chiles like pasilla, ancho, and guajillo are mild and we suggest giving them a try when used in a Mexican recipe!"
