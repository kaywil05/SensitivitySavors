                    <p>As a graduate student, I spend my time trying to pass classes and enjoying life before I go into the industry! I love to travel, watch anime, and eat at cool restaurants. My current favorite food is ramen; the fancy kind with an egg in it. I am hoping to travel more with friends this year, and make memories while we are all together.</p>

                    <p>I am currently a graduate student at New Mexico State University pursuing my Master's in Computer Science. Outside of computer science, I have a lot of hobbies. The hobby that is currently taking up most of my time is dancing. I currently take lessons at Sol Ballroom and know the basics of salsa, bachata, foxtrot, tango, cha cha, waltz, east coast swing, and west coast swing. Another thing I really enjoy is travelling. I've been to 14 different countries and visited 28 states in the USA.</p>

                    <p>I decided to do my masters, to avoid adulting... I may have regretted that. In my free time I love playing Tetris, Pickleball, and I love to travel and hang out with friends. A fun fact about me is that I drank so much thai tea that it turned my hair red! I am hoping to graduate in fall of 2025 and after that I am hoping to get a job in industry where I can show off my girl boss energy. Since I am only 4ft 11in I will be wearing high heels to show my authority.</p>

                    <p>I am currently a PhD student working on Data Mining and Machine Learning. I want to become an independent researcher working in industry. After my graduation, I'm going to develop some new hobbies such as hiking. I would love to explore more about America's nature, especially its national parks.
